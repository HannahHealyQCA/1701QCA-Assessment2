# 1701QCA Making Interaction - Assessment 2 workbook

You will use this workbook to keep track of your progress through the course and also as a process journal to document the making of your projects. The comments in italics throughout the template give suggestions about what to include. Feel free to delete those instructions when you have completed the sections.

When you have completed the template, submit the link to the GitHub Pages site for this repository as a link in Learning@Griffith. The link should be something like [https://qcainteractivemedia.github.io/1701QCA-Assessment2/](https://qcainteractivemedia.github.io/1701QCA-Assessment2/) where `qcainteractivemedia` is replaced with your GitHub username and `1701QCA-Assessment2` is replaced with whatever you called the repository this template is contained in when you set it up.

This project is related to mine because *insert reasons here*.

## Other research ##
*Include here any other relevant research you have done. This might include identifying readings, tutorials, videos, technical documents, or other resources that have been helpful. For each particular source, add a comment or two about why it is relevant or what you have taken from it.*

### *Brief resource name/description* ###

*Provide a link, reference, or whatever is required for somebody else to find the resource. Then provide a few comments about what you have drawn from the resource.*

## Conceptual progress ##

### Design intent ###
My design intention for this project is a device/model that creates an interactive experience that visually depicts a short narrative in a physical space.

### Design concept 1 ###
A mechanical electronic wall art that visually depicts a story that is read along with it. This idea could include moving parts, lights, sound and many other interactions.

Strengths
- Can be expanded in many ways 
- Visually engaging and pleasing 
- Can be created based on basically any short story 

Limitations
- Complicated and complex,combining electronics with mechanical parts 
- Will take a long time 
- May be difficult to source materials 
- Will need alot of research

(This is an image of the planning and design process development for design concept 1).
*Outline three design concepts, each developed to a point where you anticipate it would be feasible to complete by the end of the course. Each should have a summary of the idea, a rough sketch of what it might be like, and any other notes you created while exploring the idea.* 

*Put the first two design concepts in the sections "Design concept 1" and "Design concept 2". Then put the third, with more development in the section "Final design concept".*

### Design concept 2 ###
A room interactive art installation where the action automatically starts to happen around you and your choices determine the storyline. It would be 'choose your own adventure' style as if your are in your own movie.

Strengths
- Immersive experience 
- Can be customised to any story 

Limitations
- Would take a long time 
- Too large 

- Would have to be scaled down 
- Do not have access to such a large space

### Final design concept ###
A miniature model room that visually depicts a narrative in a physical model. A book is read along with it and as the action happens in writing it begins to occur in the scene in front of you.

Strengths
- Moderately easy to make as it is small 
- Easy to source materials 
- A lot of resources online 
- Could be used as a portable device 
- Can be cutomised to any story 
- Can be marketed to any target audience 
- Many different ways to execute eg. different sensors and action that could take place 

Limitations
- Could take some time 
- Would need some experimenting and prototyping

(This is an image of my final design concept initial planning).

*This more fully developed concept should include consideration of the interaction scheme, technical functionality, fabrication approach, materials to be used, and aesthetic.*

### Interaction flowchart ###
*Draw a draft flowchart of what you anticipate the interaction process in your project to be. Make sure you think about all the stages of interaction step-by-step. Also make sure that you consider actions a user might take that aren't what you intend in an ideal use case. Insert an image of it below. It might just be a photo of a hand-drawn sketch, not a carefully drawn digital diagram. It just needs to be legible.*

## Physical experimentation documentation ##

*In this section, show your progress including whichever of the following are appropriate for your project at this point.
a.	Technical development. Could be code screenshots, pictures of electronics and hardware testing, video of tests. 
b.	Fabrication. Physical models, rough prototypes, sketches, diagrams of form, material considerations, mood boards, etc.
Ensure you include comments about the choices you've made along the way.*

*You will probably have a range of images and screenshots. Any test videos should be uploaded to YouTube or other publicly accessible site and a link provided here.*

## Design process discussion ##
*Discuss your process in getting to this point, particularly with reference to aspects of the Double Diamond design methodology or other relevant design process.*

## Next steps ##
*Write a list or provide other information about your plan to move the project forward to be ready to present by video and documentation in week 12 of the course.*
