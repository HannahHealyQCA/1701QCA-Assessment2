*Charles Matton- 'Enclosure'*

*https://www.allvisualarts.org/artists/CharlesMatton/biography.aspx*

![Image](relatedproject1.jpg)

Charles Matton was a painter, sculptor, designer, writer, photographer, videographer, and filmmaker. His work aimed to capture the tension in living things and animate nature by provoking and perfecting life. In his exhibition 'enclosures', Matton created small scale interiors within transparent boxes with glass fronts. Depicting theatrical, atmospheric scenes, the miniatures spaces are based on real world interiors and memories from Matton's life. Each scene is meticulously hand-built to a 1/7 scale. To create a more immersive experience and to depict not just how something looked ona particular day but how it felt, Matton introduced one-way mirrors and videos to add hypnotic optical illusions.

This exhibition is related to my project as it is created in miniature scale and visually depicts a story through the immense detail that make the small scenes seem so life-like. It is also related to my project as it uses electronics to create a more immersive interactive experience rather than just an art piece to admire. This project has inspired me to include many minute details so I can replicate a moment in time more accurately and make the scene more life-like, thus creating a more interesting and immersive expereince for the audience.

Andy Acres is a London artist that specialises in creating highly detailed and visually dynamic models and scale miniatures. Usually creating ghostly ambiences, one of Acres' works are spooky shadow box diaromas. Within these models, Acres' uses LEDs to create creepy shadows that serve as a background to emphasise the small details. the lights can also be adjusted through an antique toggle on the side of the diaroma. By creating life-like scenes that create experiences, Acres' wants his work "to not only breathe life but to exhale".

This project is related to my project because they are both in a miniature scale and wuuse electronics. SImilar to Acres' I will also be using LEDs to create atmospheric lighting. I also want to make the scene look as realistic as possible by emphasising the small details. I wish to replicate Acres' notion of creating such a life-like scene that the scene not only breathes life but exhales.

Joshua Smith is a South Australian miniaturist and former stencil artist. Smith's miniature work mainly focuses on the ofte overlooked aspects of the urban landscape. Smith depicts things like graffiti, abandoned locations, rust and decay. In his own words Smith states, "The works I create are of buildings long forgotten and soon to be demolished. I capture their current state of a once thriving but long forgotten space.‚Äù Smith works on a 1:20 scale and uses everyday materials such as MDF, cardboard, and plastic.
This project is similar to mine as it is also created in a miniature scale. they are alos related as I will be using everday materials aswell. Within my scene I also want to add a sense of a forgotten space by using retro themed furniature and creating a dated almost abandoned look. This artist has inspired me to expand the narrative further by adding more small details that develop the realness of the scene and incorporating an old vintage feel.

## Conceptual progress ##

### Design intent ###
My design intention for this project is a device/model that creates an interactive experience that visually depicts a short narrative in a physical space.

### Design concept 1 ###
A mechanical electronic wall art that visually depicts a story that is read along with it. This idea could include moving parts, lights, sound and many other interactions.

Strengths
- Can be expanded in many ways 
- Visually engaging and pleasing 
- Can be created based on basically any short story 

Limitations
- Complicated and complex,combining electronics with mechanical parts 
- Will take a long time 
- May be difficult to source materials 
- Will need alot of research

(This is an image of the planning and design process development for design concept 1).
*Outline three design concepts, each developed to a point where you anticipate it would be feasible to complete by the end of the course. Each should have a summary of the idea, a rough sketch of what it might be like, and any other notes you created while exploring the idea.* 

*Put the first two design concepts in the sections "Design concept 1" and "Design concept 2". Then put the third, with more development in the section "Final design concept".*

### Design concept 2 ###
A room interactive art installation where the action automatically starts to happen around you and your choices determine the storyline. It would be 'choose your own adventure' style as if your are in your own movie.

Strengths
- Immersive experience 
- Can be customised to any story 

Limitations
- Would take a long time 
- Too large 

- Would have to be scaled down 
- Do not have access to such a large space

(Above is an image of design concept 2).

### Final design concept ###
A miniature model room that visually depicts a narrative in a physical model. A book is read along with it and as the action happens in writing it begins to occur in the scene in front of you.

Strengths
- Moderately easy to make as it is small 
- Easy to source materials 
- A lot of resources online 
- Could be used as a portable device 
- Can be cutomised to any story 
- Can be marketed to any target audience 
- Many different ways to execute eg. different sensors and action that could take place 

Limitations
- Could take some time 
- Would need some experimenting and prototyping

(This is an image of my final design concept initial planning).

*This more fully developed concept should include consideration of the interaction scheme, technical functionality, fabrication approach, materials to be used, and aesthetic.*

### Interaction flowchart ###
*Draw a draft flowchart of what you anticipate the interaction process in your project to be. Make sure you think about all the stages of interaction step-by-step. Also make sure that you consider actions a user might take that aren't what you intend in an ideal use case. Insert an image of it below. It might just be a photo of a hand-drawn sketch, not a carefully drawn digital diagram. It just needs to be legible.*

## Physical experimentation documentation ##

*In this section, show your progress including whichever of the following are appropriate for your project at this point.
a.	Technical development. Could be code screenshots, pictures of electronics and hardware testing, video of tests. 
b.	Fabrication. Physical models, rough prototypes, sketches, diagrams of form, material considerations, mood boards, etc.
Ensure you include comments about the choices you've made along the way.*

*You will probably have a range of images and screenshots. Any test videos should be uploaded to YouTube or other publicly accessible site and a link provided here.*

## Design process discussion ##
*Discuss your process in getting to this point, particularly with reference to aspects of the Double Diamond design methodology or other relevant design process.*

## Next steps ##
*Write a list or provide other information about your plan to move the project forward to be ready to present by video and documentation in week 12 of the course.*
